# Emlang Specification v0.1.0

Emlang is a YAML-based DSL for describing systems with Event Modeling patterns.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Overview

- An Emlang file MUST be a valid YAML file
- Each YAML document MUST contain a `slices` top-level key
- A file MAY contain multiple YAML documents separated by `---`
- The root object MUST NOT contain properties other than `slices`

```yaml
---
slices:
  SliceName:
    - t: Swimlane/TriggerName
    - c: DoSomething
    - e: SomethingDone
```

## Elements

Emlang defines 5 element types, each with multiple prefix forms:

| Type      | Short | Acronym | Long         |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Trigger   | `t:`  | `trg:`  | `trigger:`   |
| Command   | `c:`  | `cmd:`  | `command:`   |
| Event     | `e:`  | `evt:`  | `event:`     |
| Exception | `x:`  | `err:`  | `exception:` |
| View      | `v:`  | —       | `view:`      |

- All prefix forms of a given type are semantically equivalent
- An element MUST contain exactly one type key
- An element MUST NOT contain more than one type key
- An element MAY contain a `props` key
- An element MUST NOT contain keys other than one type key and `props`

```yaml
# ✅ Valid
- c: RegisterUser
- e: UserRegistered

# ❌ Invalid: two type keys in the same item
- c: RegisterUser
  e: UserRegistered
```

### Naming

- Element names are free-form text
- Names MAY contain spaces, accents, and special characters

```yaml
- c: RegisterUser
- e: Utilisateur enregistré
```

### Swimlanes

- Swimlanes are OPTIONAL
- A swimlane MUST be specified as a prefix separated by `/` before the element name

```yaml
- t: Customer/RegistrationForm   # Swimlane: Customer
- e: User/UserRegistered         # Swimlane: User
- c: RegisterUser                # No swimlane
```

### Properties

- Properties are OPTIONAL
- Properties MUST be defined under a `props` key
- The `props` value MUST be an object
- The structure of `props` is free-form — consuming tools decide how to interpret them

```yaml
- c: RegisterUser
  props:
    email: string
    password: string
```

## Slices

- A slice is a named sequence of elements representing a business scenario
- A slice MUST contain at least one element
- A slice MUST be in either direct form or extended form

### Direct Form

- The direct form is a list of elements
- SHOULD be used when a slice has no attached tests

```yaml
slices:
  UserRegistration:
    - t: Customer/RegistrationForm
    - c: RegisterUser
    - e: User/UserRegistered
    - v: UserProfile
```

### Extended Form

- The extended form is an object with `steps` and optionally `tests`
- `steps` is REQUIRED and MUST be an element list
- `tests` is OPTIONAL
- The extended form MUST NOT contain properties other than `steps` and `tests`

```yaml
slices:
  UserRegistration:
    steps:
      - t: Customer/RegistrationForm
      - c: RegisterUser
      - e: User/UserRegistered
    tests:
      EmailMustBeUnique:
        given:
          - e: User/UserRegistered
            props:
              email: joe@example.com
        when:
          - c: RegisterUser
            props:
              email: joe@example.com
        then:
          - x: EmailAlreadyInUse
```

### Multiple Slices

- Multiple slices MAY be defined in the same document
- Both direct and extended forms MAY coexist in the same document

```yaml
slices:
  UserRegistration:
    - t: Customer/RegistrationForm
    - c: RegisterUser
    - e: User/UserRegistered

  UserLogin:
    - t: Customer/LoginForm
    - c: AuthenticateUser
    - e: User/UserAuthenticated
    - v: Dashboard
```

### Anonymous Slices

- `slices` MAY be an element list instead of a named object
- Anonymous slices are not referenceable by name

```yaml
slices:
  - t: Customer/ContactForm
  - c: SubmitInquiry
  - e: InquiryReceived
```

## Tests

- Tests MUST be defined inside a slice using the extended form
- A slice MUST contain at least one test if `tests` is present
- Each test follows a Given-When-Then structure

### Test Structure

| Section  | Required | Allowed element types      |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|
| `given`  | No       | `e` (event), `v` (view)    |
| `when`   | Yes      | `c` (command)              |
| `then`   | Yes      | `e` (event), `v` (view), `x` (exception) |

- `when` is REQUIRED and MUST contain exactly one command element
- `then` is REQUIRED and MUST contain at least one element
- `given` is OPTIONAL but, if present, MUST contain at least one element
- `given` elements MUST be events or views
- `then` elements MUST be events, views, or exceptions
- A test MUST NOT contain properties other than `given`, `when`, and `then`

```yaml
tests:
  EmailMustBeUnique:
    given:
      - e: User/UserRegistered
        props:
          email: joe@example.com
    when:
      - c: RegisterUser
        props:
          email: joe@example.com
    then:
      - x: EmailAlreadyInUse
```

### Multiple Tests

- A slice MAY contain multiple named tests

```yaml
tests:
  EmailMustBeUnique:
    given:
      - e: UserRegistered
        props:
          email: joe@example.com
    when:
      - c: RegisterUser
        props:
          email: joe@example.com
    then:
      - x: EmailAlreadyInUse

  PasswordMustBeStrong:
    when:
      - c: RegisterUser
        props:
          password: "123"
    then:
      - x: PasswordTooWeak
```

## Document Structure

- A file MAY contain one or more YAML documents
- Documents MUST be separated by `---`
- Each document MUST independently conform to this specification

```yaml
---
slices:
  UserRegistration:
    - t: Customer/RegistrationForm
    - c: RegisterUser
    - e: User/UserRegistered

---
slices:
  UserDeletion:
    steps:
      - t: Admin/UserManagement
      - c: DeleteUser
      - e: User/UserDeleted
    tests:
      CannotDeleteActiveUser:
        given:
          - e: User/UserAuthenticated
        when:
          - c: DeleteUser
        then:
          - x: UserCurrentlyActive
```

## Comments

- Standard YAML comments (`#`) MAY be used anywhere

```yaml
slices:
  OrderPlacement:
    - t: Customer/ProductPage    # User clicks "Buy Now"
    - c: PlaceOrder              # Validates inventory
    - e: Order/OrderPlaced       # Core domain event
```
