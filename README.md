# Emlang Specification

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/emlang-project/spec)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/emlang-project/spec)

Emlang is a text-based DSL for describing systems with Event Modeling patterns.

## Why Emlang?

Event Modeling is typically done using visual tools like Miro or oNote. These tools are great for collaboration, but diagrams don't fit naturally into a developer's workflow — they can't be versioned, diffed, or reviewed like code.

Emlang bridges that gap:

- **Text-based** — Version control, diffs, code review workflows
- **Parseable** — Tools can generate diagrams, code, or documentation
- **Complementary** — Works alongside visual tools, not against them

Visual diagrams remain the best way to understand a system. Emlang is a versionable source format that tools can parse to generate those diagrams.

## Philosophy

Emlang is **minimalist**:

- **Syntax, not semantics** — Emlang defines how to write elements, not what makes a valid model
- **No methodology enforcement** — Event Modeling rules live at https://eventmodeling.org/
- **Tool responsibility** — Validation and code generation are done by separate tools

## Quick Reference

| Notation | Type      | Description           |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| `/.../`  | Flow      | Business scenario     |
| `%...%`  | Trigger   | Initiates an action   |
| `[...]`  | Command   | Action/intent         |
| `<...>`  | Event     | Past fact             |
| `!...!`  | Exception | Failure/error         |
| `{...}`  | View      | Projection/Read Model |
| `?...?`  | Test      | Given-When-Then test  |

## Examples

### User Registration

A complete flow showing a user registering through a form:

```emlang
/RegisterUser/
  %Customer:RegistrationForm%
  [RegisterUser]
    email
    password
  <User:UserRegistered>
    userId
    email
    registeredAt
  {UserProfile}
    userId
    email
```

### E-Commerce Checkout

Multiple sequences within a single flow, representing chronological breaks:

```emlang
/Checkout/
  %Customer:Cart%
  [StartCheckout]
  <Order:CheckoutStarted>
    orderId
    customerId
    items
  {CheckoutSummary}
  ---
  %Customer:CheckoutSummary%
  [SubmitPayment]
    orderId
    paymentMethod
  <Order:PaymentSubmitted>
  <Payment:PaymentProcessed>
  {OrderConfirmation}
  ---
  %Customer:OrderConfirmation%
```

### Multiple Flows with Tests

A document containing related flows and their tests:

```emlang
/RegisterUser/
  %Customer:RegistrationForm%
  [RegisterUser]
    email
    password
  <User:UserRegistered>
    userId
    email
  {UserProfile}
---
/LoginUser/
  %Customer:LoginForm%
  [LoginUser]
    email
    password
  <User:UserLoggedIn>
    userId
    sessionId
  {Dashboard}
---
?RegistrationCreatesProfile?
  [RegisterUser]
    email:alice@example.com
    password:secret123
  <User:UserRegistered>
    userId:user-1
    email:alice@example.com
---
?DuplicateEmailRejected?
  <User:UserRegistered>
    email:alice@example.com
  [RegisterUser]
    email:alice@example.com
    password:newpassword
  !EmailAlreadyUsed!
    email:alice@example.com
```

### Event Storming Notes

Partial flows are valid — useful for early exploration:

```emlang
/OrderLifecycle/
  <OrderPlaced>
  <PaymentReceived>
  <OrderShipped>
  <OrderDelivered>
---
/OrderCancellation/
  <OrderPlaced>
  <OrderCancelled>
  <RefundIssued>
```
